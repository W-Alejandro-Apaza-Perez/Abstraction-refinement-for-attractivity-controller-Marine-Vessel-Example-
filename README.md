# Abstraction-refinement-for-attractivity-controller
Attractivity specifications consist in driving the state of a system to a target region and keeping it in that region afterward. In this project, we develop an approach to controller synthesis for attractivity specifications based on iterative refinements of symbolic abstractions.
